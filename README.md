# Random Flickr Image Web Component

This web component will retrieve and display a new random Flickr image every 5 seconds.

## Running the code

- To run this exercise, you will need a local (or remote) web server, server is required to serve only static files
- Deploy this project into an accessible folder anywhere on your server
- Point your browser to the appropriate path
- Currently only Google Chrome is tested, but polyfill (webcomponents.js) is present
- This exercise imports two libraries from CDN (webcomponents.js, jQuery), which means you have to be online to run the project
- Random images are random, may be NSFW

## Tests
